# Jax-Orio

`3D hack and slash game using Godot. Jax Orio, a drunken former Knight, must protect his village of Stonemarsh from invading Orcs and Trolls!`

## The Leaping Deer Inn in Stonemarsh, a small village in Medieval England

### Rumours of strange creatures roaming the rural areas of England were abound. In the Leaping Deer Inn one night the talk was of Orcs and Trolls

#### "Who's going to protect us?" said Gus the Wise. "All the knights have left Stonemarsh."

#### "Wot about Sir Boliveer the Brave and 'Andsome!!!" said Dorg the Fisherman

#### "Erm Sir Boli is off crusading idiot," said Nerys the Cook, "and Michel Ironfist naw'z chief armourer with a platoon of Knights!!!"

#### "Erick Goldenbeard!!!" cooed Mary the Baker dreamily

#### "E's off training the King's Royal Archers Mary," said Nerys sighing

#### "Ow'z 'bout Orio?" said Fred the Butcher. Howls of laughter exploded in the Inn

#### "Orio? 'E cannie walk straight looook, " said Buxom Betty, the barmaid

#### Heads turned to look at Jax Orio staggering to the bar. "Weasshal Sshtout Betsy...." said Orio before going unconscious

#### As the laughter intensified through the Leaping Deer Inn, the door suddenly burst open, letting in a gust of wind and rain. Everyone turned to see a young boy, drenched and breathless, standing in the doorway

#### "The Orcs! They're at the gates of Stonemarsh!" he cried, his voice trembling with fear

#### The room fell silent. Eyes widened, and the reality of the situation sank in. Sir Boliveer, Michel Ironfist, and Erick Goldenbeard were all away Crusading. The villagefolk exchanged worried glances, and all eyes slowly turned back to Jax Orio, now snoring softly on the floor

#### Fred the Butcher scratched his head. "We ain't got no choice, folks. It’s him or nothin'." He leaned down and patted Orio's cheek. "Oi, Orio, wake up, ya daft git!"

#### Orio stirred and opened one bleary eye. "Wot's all this, then?"

#### Betty grabbed a tankard of water and splashed it on Orio's face. "Get up, ya drunkard! We need ya."

#### Orio sat up, blinking and trying to make sense of the situation. "Need me? For wot?"

#### "The town's under attack, ya fool! Orcs and trolls! We need someone to lead us, and you're the only knight left!" Fred's voice was urgent

#### Orio staggered to his feet, swaying slightly. "Orcs, trolls... right?" He looked around the room and then passed out again

#### Outside the howls and screams of strange creatures could be heard. The crowd in the tavern looked at each other, scared and afraid, and then down at Jax Orio snoring away
